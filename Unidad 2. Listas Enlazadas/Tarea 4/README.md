# Singly Linked List

## Instructions

Implement a singly linked list.

Like an array, a linked list is a simple linear data structure. Several
common data types can be implemented using linked lists, like queues,
stacks, and associative arrays.

A linked list is a collection of data elements called *nodes*. In a
*singly linked list* each node holds a value and a link to the next node.

You will write an implementation of a singly linked list. Implement a
Node to hold a value and pointers to the next node. Then
implement a List which offers an array-like interface for adding and 
removing items:

* `push_back` (*insert value at back*);
* `pop_back` (*remove value at back*);
* `push_front` (*insert value at front*);
* `pop_front` (*remove value at front*);
* `front` (*gets the value at front*);
* `back` (*gets the value at back*);

To keep your implementation simple, the tests will not cover error
conditions. Specifically: `pop_back`, `pop_front`, `back`, `front`
will never be called on an empty list.
