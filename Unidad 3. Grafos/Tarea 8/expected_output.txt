The graph's adjacency list is:
------------------------------
A C D F
B D E
C A F
D A B E F
E B D
F A C D
G

The vertex G has degree = 0

The vertex A has degree = 3

The vertex D has degree = 4

Adding edge between the vertices G and E

The vertex G has degree = 1

Removing edge between the vertices A and D

The vertex A has degree = 2

The vertex D has degree = 3

Removing vertex with id = D

Adding vertex with id = H

The graph's adjacency list is:

A C F
B E
C A F
E B G
F A C
G E
